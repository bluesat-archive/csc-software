To do a full compile:
$ cd csc-software
$ make -C Scripts

Requires GNU ARM toolchain and perl.

Incremental compilation and/or parallel building is currently
broken. There are dependency issues. Sorry!

============

To burn to device:
$ ls /dev/ | grep tty
$ cd csc-software
$ make -C Scripts burn BURN_DEV=/dev/ttyUSB0 (or other device)

Simplest burn device for CSC >= v2 is a 5V FTDI dongle. (NOT 3.3V!)
Requires lpc21isp in your path. Ensure CSC is in ISP mode (S1) and
it has been reset.
