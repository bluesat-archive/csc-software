To do a full compile:
# cd csc-software
# make -C scripts

Requires GNU ARM toolchain and perl.

Incremental compilation is currently broken. Some source files are modified during compilation, and I wouldn't be surpised if there are also dependency issues. Sorry!

============

To burn to device:
# ls /dev/ | grep tty
# cd csc-software
# make -C scripts burn BURN_DEV=/dev/ttyUSB0 (or other device)

Requires lpc21isp in your path.
Ensure CSC is in ISP mode (S1) and it has been reset.
